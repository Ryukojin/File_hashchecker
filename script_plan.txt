stage 1 
OPTION1: test hash against clipboard hash
- gives the first option 'Test file hash'
- When successful a CLI output of the above says 'File hashes match. File integrity 100%' else 'WARNING: File hashes do not match! Integrity compromised."
Issues: 
- Stop the script when no hash found in clipboard


stage 2
- context menu further opens to a submenu to show the two options 'Use MD5' and 'Use SHA-256


stage 3 (API integration)
OPTION2: virustotal after simplying default JSON output format
- gives the 3rd option 'Scan with Virustotal' (if user has set a API key)
- Output above is a CLI displaying neccessary JSON keys and data


Stage 3 finishing touches
- Turn to .exe
- figure out the setup file to setup all neccessary reg key to build the  context menu
- Add a config menu via cli
- Let user configure an API key
- run on startup option
- Make it OS agnostic
- Dockerise it
- change output to text box GUI
